Hello, world.
=============

Hey! I hope you can excuse the mess. I'm trying to get everything up as
a static site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) on [Github
Pages](http://github.io). This is my first implementation of Jekyll, but
it looks very promising (plus I love
[Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)).

I'll try to have this design changed around to something less generic
soon enough (probably before anyone actually sees this small little
corner of the interwebs). That's not to say that the ladies and
gentlemen that are responsible for
[jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) didn't do a
fantastic job with their boilerplate jekyll repo. I highly recommend
checking it out.
